# Outer Haven

**A place outside centralized control.**

Outer Haven is a community chat platform inspired by the usability of modern tools like Discord, but built on a fundamentally different foundation: **cryptographic identity instead of accounts, privacy by architecture instead of policy, and decentralization without sacrificing usability**.

The goal is not to evade moderation or law, but to build a system where communities can function normally **without requiring centralized user identity, personal data collection, or platform-level control**.

---

## Motivation

Modern communication platforms increasingly require:
- centralized accounts
- permanent identifiers (email, phone number, government ID)
- invasive verification mechanisms
- trust in operators not to misuse collected data

Outer Haven explores a different approach:

> If a system does not collect sensitive data, it cannot be abused, leaked, or demanded.

Rather than promising privacy, Outer Haven aims to **enforce it by design**.

## Core Ideas

- **No global accounts** (no email, phone number, or real-world identity)
- **Pseudonymous but stable identity** via cryptographic keys
- **Multi-device support** without central login systems
- **End-to-end encrypted private communication**
- **Self-hostable servers**, with optional federation
- **Compliance through technical enforcement**, not data collection

---

## Project Status

Outer Haven is in early active development.

Planned milestones:
- **v0.1** – Identity, sessions, device pairing
- **v0.2** – Servers and text chat
- **v0.3** – Direct messages (1-hop relay)
- **v0.4** – Voice
- **v0.5** – Federation
- **v0.6** – Zero-knowledge claims (e.g. age verification)

## Documentation

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` – system design and components
- `SECURITY.md` – threat model and security assumptions

---

## Non-Goals

- No advertising or tracking
- No real-name policies
- No global moderation authority
- No mandatory central services
