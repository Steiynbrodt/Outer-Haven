# Architecture Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of Outer Haven.
Terminology used in this document is defined in docs/GLOSSARY.md
---

## Identity Model

### Cryptographic Identity
- Each user has a **root key pair** (pseudonymous identity)
- No global usernames, emails, or phone numbers
- Identity is proven by cryptographic signatures, not credentials

### Devices
- Each device has its own **device key**
- Devices are authorized via **delegation from the root key**
- Delegation is typically done via **QR-based pairing**
- Devices can be revoked independently

### Usernames
- Usernames are **local to a server**
- Bound to the root public key
- Displayed globally as `@username@server`

---

## Authentication

- Challenge–response signatures
- No passwords sent over the network
- No server-side password storage

### Local Protection
Passwords and biometrics are used **only locally**:
- To encrypt/decrypt the root private key at rest
- To lock/unlock the application on a device

Passwords never identify a user and never leave the device.

## Communication Modes (Two-Lane Model)

Outer Haven supports two transport modes with different privacy/usability trade-offs.

### Realtime Mode (Default)
Goal: high usability and low latency.
- WebSocket/QUIC-style realtime delivery
- Presence, typing indicators, read states may be supported
- Suitable for large communities and interactive chat
- Does NOT claim resistance to global traffic correlation by state-level adversaries

### Mix Mode (Opt-in High Anonymity)
Goal: raise the cost of traffic analysis and correlation.
- Text messaging only (no voice/video)
- Batched delivery with delays and/or constant-rate padded traffic
- Cover traffic may be generated by clients/relays
- Presence/typing/read receipts are disabled or heavily restricted
- Designed to reduce metadata leakage, but cannot protect compromised endpoints
## Servers (Communities)
Servers host:
- Channels
- Roles
- Public or semi-public chat
- Voice channels (Realtime Mode only)

Servers:
- Never require real-world identity
- Store only public keys and minimal metadata
- Enforce rules locally

---

## Direct Messages (DMs)
DM delivery can use either mode:
- Realtime Mode: low-latency relay delivery
- Mix Mode: batched/delayed relay delivery with optional padding/cover traffic

- End-to-end encrypted
- Servers do not have access to plaintext
- Transported via **relay nodes**

### Relay Nodes
- Any server may optionally act as a DM relay
- Relay participation is explicit and opt-in
- Default policy: **members-only**
- Relays see only ciphertext and mailbox identifiers
- Store-and-forward is supported for offline delivery

---

## Federation (Planned)

- Optional server-to-server communication
- No central authority
- Signed events
- Global identity = cryptographic key

---
## Message Confidentiality Model

Outer Haven separates transport security from end-to-end encryption.

### Transport Encryption
All client–server and server–server communication is encrypted in transit using TLS.
This protects against network-level observers but does not hide data from the server itself.

### Direct Messages
Direct messages are end-to-end encrypted.
Servers and relay nodes cannot read message contents.

### Server Channels (Default)
By default, server channels are not end-to-end encrypted.
Messages are readable by the hosting server to allow moderation, indexing, and usability
similar to existing community platforms.

### Private Channels (Planned)
End-to-end encrypted server channels are planned as an optional per-channel mode.
In this mode, only channel members can read message contents, and the server stores
only encrypted data.

This model allows strong privacy where needed without sacrificing usability by default.

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Planned)

Used for **claims**, not identity:
- Age verification (e.g. 18+)
- Rate-limiting
- Membership proofs

Servers verify proofs without learning personal data.

---
## Metadata Controls

Outer Haven treats metadata as a first-class privacy risk.

- Realtime Mode prioritizes usability; metadata minimization is best-effort.
- Mix Mode prioritizes anonymity; UX features that leak timing/graph metadata
  (presence, typing, read receipts, voice/video) are disabled or restricted.
## Technology Stack (Planned)

- TypeScript: core services and clients
- Rust (later): security-critical components and ZKP verification
- WebSockets: realtime communication
- PostgreSQL / Redis: minimal state
- LiveKit: self-hosted voice
- libsodium / noble: cryptographic primitives
- Mix Mode components (planned): batching scheduler, padding/cover traffic engine, relay selection logic
