# Building Rules

This file exists to protect the project (and the author) from scope creep,
burnout, and premature complexity.

These rules override excitement, new ideas, and perfectionism.

---

## Core Rules

- This project is built one brick at a time.
- A brick must be finishable in under 1 hour.
- A brick produces a visible artifact (document, issue, decision).
- Stopping early is allowed and expected.
- No brick may introduce more than one new concept.

---

## Scope Control

- New ideas are recorded as GitHub issues and not implemented immediately.
- If an idea cannot be completed in one brick, it is split or deferred.
- “Just one more thing” is a stop signal, not a reason to continue.

---

## Implementation Order

- Architecture and threat model come before code.
- Correctness comes before performance.
- Usability comes before optional hardening.
- Optional features remain optional.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals (for now)

The following are intentionally not implemented until later milestones:
- Onion routing
- Federation
- Voice
- Full E2EE for server channels
- Production-grade infrastructure

---

## Personal Constraints

- This project must remain enjoyable to work on.
- Burnout is considered a failure mode.
- Slow progress is acceptable; abandonment is not.
